--- [G] Handling a series of lines of output:
--- Here, link:
---    "mplayer-k6:"      to "i get the msg"
---    "Depends: ..."     to both the line one previous, and "i get the msg"
---    "What's wrong?"    to "mplayer-k6"
---    <henry>'s 1st msg  to "What's wrong?"
---    <henry>'s 2nd msg  to the "Depends: libggi" message
--- The intuition is that messages in the sequence are all linked together in a chain, and also linked to the message the chunk is a response to. 
--- Follow-up messages (including from the same user) are linked to the message that is most semantically relevant, or the top of the chunk if they are generally a response to the whole chunk.
