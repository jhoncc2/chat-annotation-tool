--- For <dankan>'s messages, you need to either:
--- (1) Link both of them to the last message from <Onepamopa>
--- (2) Link both of them to both of <Onepamopa>'s messages.
--- You should do (1) when <Onepamopa>'s messages formed a single question. Do
--- (2) when they formed separate questions, but somehow were both answered at
--- the same time.
